		In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants that is formed from the ovary after flowering. Fruits are the means by which flowering plants disseminate their seeds

		A fruit is the part of a flowering plant that contains the seeds. The skin of a fruit may be thin, tough, or hard. Its insides are often sweet and juicy. But some fruits, including nuts, are dry. Fruits develop from a plant's flowers.
