		Hello my name Is Raj,<br>
		and I am a student studying in 10th grade.

		How I got Into web dev: <br><br>
		I was not sure where to start and I started learning html and css In freecodecamp (which is a great website, sure check that out) but in the middle i got bored of it and my interest shifted towards python as also some of my friends suggested and now i am here.. <br>
		Thanks to UDEMY and Andrei that I continue to learn and hope that I will succeed my dream of becoming a web developer one day :)
